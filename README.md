# Claude Master 🧠⚡

> **The AI-First Development Framework That Actually Gets Shit Done**

Stop drowning in tickets. Stop guessing what to build next. Stop pretending project management tools work.

**Claude Master** is the coding framework that thinks ahead, plans smart, and executes flawlessly. Built for developers who want their AI to actually understand their workflow, not just spit out code.

## What This Framework Solves

**Claude Master** addresses the core challenges developers face with project management:

**Context Loss**: Traditional tools don't understand your codebase or technical decisions  
**Task Ambiguity**: Tickets that say "implement auth" without breaking down the actual work  
**Dependency Hell**: Blocked tasks and unclear sequencing that kills momentum  
**Research Overhead**: Constantly context-switching between coding and researching best practices  

**Claude Master provides:**
- **Contextual Intelligence**: AI that understands your project structure and technical context
- **Intelligent Task Breakdown**: Complex features automatically split into manageable, sequential tasks  
- **Research Integration**: On-demand technical guidance without leaving your development flow
- **Dependency Management**: Clear task sequencing based on actual technical dependencies

## Framework Philosophy

**Claude Master** is built around three core principles:

### AI-First Development
Your development tools should understand your project context, not just execute isolated commands. Claude Master creates persistent project intelligence that evolves with your codebase.

### Contextual Intelligence
- 12 essential commands that integrate with your project structure
- AI-powered task generation from requirements to actionable code
- Intelligent complexity analysis that prevents scope creep
- Dependency management based on actual technical relationships
- Research-backed development guidance contextual to your stack

## Quick Start

### One-Command Setup
```bash
# Clone the framework
git clone https://github.com/raphaelchristi/claude-master
cd claude-master

# Install everything
./install.sh --complete
```

### Start Your First Project
```bash
/project-setup    # AI initializes your project structure
/create-prd      # Chat with AI to define what you're building  
/parse-prd       # AI generates actionable tasks from your vision
/next-task       # AI tells you exactly what to code next
```

**That's it.** No configuration files. No complex setup. No lengthy tutorials.

## How You Use This Framework

### Slash Commands (Direct Execution)
```bash
/project-setup          # AI sets up your entire project structure
/create-prd            # AI interviews you about what you want to build
/next-task             # AI tells you exactly what to code next
/complete-task 5       # AI validates your work and updates the plan
```

### Enhanced Commands (With Parameters)
```bash
/research "authentication best practices for React apps"
/quick-task "Add loading spinners to all form buttons"  
/break-down 12         # Split complex task into manageable pieces
/complexity            # AI analyzes your project's complexity
```

### Natural Language (Conversational)
```bash
"Show me what I should work on next"
"This task seems too complex, help me break it down"
"I'm stuck on authentication, what are the best patterns?"
"How's my project looking? Any blockers?"
```

### Usage Modes
Pick your interaction style based on the situation:
- **Direct commands**: For rapid execution of known actions
- **Enhanced commands**: For commands that need specific parameters  
- **Natural language**: For exploration, planning, and guidance
