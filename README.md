# Claude Master 🧠⚡

> **The AI-First Development Framework That Actually Gets Shit Done**

Stop drowning in tickets. Stop guessing what to build next. Stop pretending project management tools work.

**Claude Master** is the coding framework that thinks ahead, plans smart, and executes flawlessly. Built for developers who want their AI to actually understand their workflow, not just spit out code.

## 🔥 Why This Framework Exists

**Because traditional project management sucks for developers:**

❌ Jira makes you want to cry  
❌ Trello is just fancy sticky notes  
❌ Linear costs more than your coffee addiction  
❌ GitHub Projects is... well, it tries  

✅ **Claude Master**: AI that actually understands your codebase  
✅ **Contextual Intelligence**: Knows what you're building before you do  
✅ **Zero Ceremony**: No standups, no ceremonies, just pure coding flow  
✅ **Vibe-Driven Development**: Work with energy, not against bureaucracy  

## 🧠 The Framework Philosophy

**Claude Master** isn't just another tool - it's a development philosophy that embraces:

### 🎯 **AI-First Thinking**
Your AI should understand your project context, not just execute random commands. Claude Master creates persistent project intelligence that grows with your codebase.

### ⚡ **Vibe-Driven Development** 
Work when you're in flow. The framework adapts to your energy, not the other way around. No daily standups, no sprint ceremonies - just pure coding momentum.

### 🔥 **Zero Ceremony, Maximum Output**
Skip the meetings. Skip the planning poker. Skip the retrospectives. Let AI handle the boring stuff while you build the future.

### 🧠 **Contextual Intelligence**
- **12 Essential Slash Commands** that actually make sense
- **AI-Powered Task Generation** from vague ideas to actionable code
- **Intelligent Complexity Analysis** that prevents scope creep
- **Dependency Management** that doesn't make you want to quit
- **Research-Backed Development** guidance when you're stuck

## ⚡ Get Started in 60 Seconds

### 🚀 **One-Command Setup**
```bash
# Clone the framework
git clone https://github.com/raphaelchristi/claude-master
cd claude-master

# Install everything (seriously, it's that easy)
./install.sh --complete
```

### 🎯 **Start Your First Project**
```bash
/project-setup    # AI initializes your project structure
/create-prd      # Chat with AI to define what you're building  
/parse-prd       # AI generates actionable tasks from your vision
/next-task       # AI tells you exactly what to code next
```

**That's it.** No configuration files. No YAML hell. No "getting started" tutorials that take 3 hours.

## 🎮 How You Actually Use This Framework

### 🔥 **Slash Commands** (The Fast Lane)
```bash
/project-setup          # AI sets up your entire project structure
/create-prd            # AI interviews you about what you want to build
/next-task             # AI tells you exactly what to code next
/complete-task 5       # AI validates your work and updates the plan
```

### 🧠 **Enhanced Commands** (When You Need More Control)
```bash
/research "authentication best practices for React apps"
/quick-task "Add loading spinners to all form buttons"  
/break-down 12         # Split complex task into bite-sized pieces
/complexity            # AI analyzes your project's complexity
```

### 💬 **Natural Language** (Just Talk to Your AI)
```bash
"Show me what I should work on next"
"This task seems too complex, help me break it down"
"I'm stuck on authentication, what are the best patterns?"
"How's my project looking? Any blockers?"
```

### 🎯 **The Vibe Check** 
Pick your mode based on your energy level:
- **High energy**: Slash commands for rapid execution
- **Medium energy**: Enhanced commands for guided work  
- **Low energy**: Natural language for exploration and planning

## 🎯 **The Framework Command Arsenal**

### 🏗️ **Foundation Commands** (Set Up Once, Build Forever)
```bash

## 🚀 **Framework Installation** (Actually Easy)

### 🎯 **What You Need** (The Boring Stuff)
```bash
# Node.js (because everything needs Node.js these days)
# macOS: brew install node
# Ubuntu: sudo apt install nodejs npm  
# Windows: Download from nodejs.org

# Claude Code CLI (the magic happens here)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### ⚡ **AI Model Keys** (Optional But You Want These)
- **OpenAI API key** - For the smart models that actually work
- **Anthropic API key** - For Claude models (obviously)  
- **Google API key** - For Gemini when you want variety
- **Perplexity API key** - For research that doesn't suck

### 🔥 **Install the Framework** (One Command to Rule Them All)
```bash
# Get the framework
git clone https://github.com/raphaelchristi/claude-master
cd claude-master

# Install everything (the installer is actually smart)
./install.sh --complete
```

**That's it.** The installer handles:
- ✅ Checks if you have the right dependencies
- ✅ Installs Claude Code CLI if you forgot
- ✅ Sets up the framework globally and locally  
- ✅ Configures TaskMaster AI with your API keys
- ✅ Gives you a working system in under 2 minutes

### 🎯 **Installation Modes** (Pick Your Vibe)
```bash
./install.sh --global    # Use across all projects (recommended)
./install.sh --local     # This project only
./install.sh --both      # Best of both worlds
./install.sh --complete  # Everything + TaskMaster setup
./install.sh --mcp-only  # Just the TaskMaster integration
```

### 📋 **Installation Types**

| Type | Command | Best For | Location |
|------|---------|----------|----------|
| **Global** | `./install.sh --global` | Daily use across all projects | `~/.claude/` |
| **Local** | `./install.sh --local` | Project-specific customization | `./commands/`, `./CLAUDE.md` |
| **Both** | `./install.sh --both` | Global access + local customization | Both locations |

### 🔧 **Manual Installation**
```bash
# Global installation
cp -r commands ~/.claude/
cp CLAUDE.md ~/.claude/

# Local installation  
cp -r commands ./
cp CLAUDE.md ./

# Verify installation
/project-setup --help
```

### 🔌 **TaskMaster AI MCP Setup**

After installing the integration, you need to add the TaskMaster AI MCP server to Claude Code:

#### **Automated MCP Installation**
```bash
# Complete setup (includes MCP installation)
./install.sh --complete

# Or install MCP only
./install.sh --mcp-only
```

#### **Manual MCP Installation**
```bash
# User scope (recommended - available in all projects)
claude mcp add taskmaster-ai -s user -- npx -y --package=task-master-ai task-master-ai

# With API keys for enhanced features
claude mcp add taskmaster-ai -s user \
  -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key \
  -e PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_key \
  -- npx -y --package=task-master-ai task-master-ai

# Verify MCP installation
claude mcp list
```

#### **MCP Scope Options**
| Scope | Command | Availability |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **User** | `-s user` | All your projects (recommended) |
| **Local** | (default) | Current project only |
| **Project** | `-s project` | Shared with team via .mcp.json |
