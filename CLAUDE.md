## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**"TaskMaster not initialized"**
```bash
/project-setup  # Run complete setup
```

**"API key invalid"**  
```bash
/models  # Check and update model configuration
```

**"No tasks available"**
```bash
/create-prd  # Create requirements first
/parse-prd   # Generate tasks from PRD
```

**"Task too complex"**
```bash
/break-down [id]  # Split into subtasks
```

**"Dependency issues"**
```bash
/task-status  # Check for blockers
# Resolve blocking tasks first
```

### Performance Optimization
- Use research model sparingly for cost efficiency
- Break down complex tasks early to improve estimates
- Regular complexity analysis prevents technical debt
- Monitor model performance with `/models`

## 🎯 Success Metrics

Expected improvements after implementation:
- **40-60%** better task clarity and sizing
- **30-50%** reduction in blocked tasks
- **25-40%** improvement in estimate accuracy  
- **20-35%** increase in development velocity
- **Significant** improvement in project predictability
