## General Topic Research

### Input: `/research "authentication patterns for web applications"`
```
üîç **Researching: Authentication Patterns for Web Applications**

üß† **Research Analysis**...
- Investigating modern authentication approaches
- Analyzing security best practices and standards
- Reviewing implementation patterns and frameworks

üìö **Research Findings**:

**üîê Modern Authentication Patterns**:

1. **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**
   - **Best For**: Stateless APIs, microservices
   - **Pros**: Scalable, self-contained, cross-domain
   - **Cons**: Token size, revocation challenges
   - **Implementation**: Auth0, Firebase Auth, custom

2. **Session-Based Authentication**
   - **Best For**: Traditional web apps, server-side rendering
   - **Pros**: Simple revocation, smaller client storage
   - **Cons**: Server state, scaling challenges
   - **Implementation**: Express-session, Django sessions

3. **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect**
   - **Best For**: Third-party auth, enterprise SSO
   - **Pros**: Standardized, delegated auth, rich ecosystem
   - **Cons**: Complexity, multiple flows
   - **Providers**: Google, Microsoft, Auth0, Okta

4. **Passwordless Authentication**
   - **Best For**: Modern UX, security-focused apps
   - **Pros**: No password vulnerabilities, better UX
   - **Cons**: Dependency on email/SMS, fallback needed
   - **Implementation**: Magic links, WebAuthn, SMS codes

**üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices**:
- **HTTPS Only**: All auth communications encrypted
- **CSRF Protection**: Use CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent brute force attacks
- **Password Security**: bcrypt/scrypt with salt, strength requirements
- **Session Security**: Secure cookies, httpOnly, sameSite
- **Token Expiration**: Short-lived access tokens with refresh tokens

**üèóÔ∏è Recommended Architecture**:
```
Frontend ‚Üî API Gateway ‚Üî Auth Service ‚Üî User Database
                ‚Üì
         Rate Limiting & CSRF Protection
```

**üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Recommendations**:

For **New Projects**:
- Start with JWT + refresh tokens
- Use established library (Passport.js, Django-auth)
- Implement OAuth for social login
- Plan for passwordless migration

For **Existing Projects**:
- Assess current security posture
- Gradual migration to modern patterns
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Comprehensive testing strategy

**üìã Potential Tasks to Create**:
Based on this research, consider these tasks:
- "Implement JWT authentication system"
- "Add OAuth integration with Google/GitHub"
- "Set up session security and CSRF protection"
- "Create passwordless login flow"
- "Add rate limiting for auth endpoints"

üéØ **Apply Research to Project**:
- Use `/quick-task` to add specific auth tasks
- Review existing auth-related tasks for updates
- Consider `/break-down` for complex auth implementations
