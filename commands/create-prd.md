# Create Comprehensive PRD

Create a detailed Product Requirements Document for the project through interactive interview.

## Instructions

1. **Interview Process**:
   - Ask structured questions about the project:
     - **Project Overview**: Name, purpose, target audience
     - **Goals & Objectives**: Business goals, success metrics
     - **User Stories**: Who are the users, what do they need
     - **Core Features**: Main functionality and features
     - **Technical Requirements**: Platform, frameworks, integrations
     - **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, security, scalability
     - **UI/UX Requirements**: Design guidelines, accessibility
     - **Constraints**: Timeline, budget, technical limitations
     - **Assumptions**: Dependencies, team capabilities

2. **Generate Structured PRD**:
   - Use responses to create comprehensive document
   - Follow standard PRD template structure
   - Include clear acceptance criteria for each requirement
   - Add priority levels (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have)
   - Define measurable success criteria

3. **Save PRD**:
   - Ensure `.taskmaster/docs/` directory exists
   - Save as `.taskmaster/docs/prd.txt`
   - Create backup with timestamp if file exists

4. **Next Steps**:
   - Offer to generate initial tasks from PRD using `/parse-prd`
   - Suggest reviewing and refining before task generation
